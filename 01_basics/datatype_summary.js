/*
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that data types of variables are 
determined by the value they hold at runtime and can change throughout the program as 
we assign different values to them.

There are two categories of data types:

1)Primitive: These are call-by-value. The types of primitive data types include String, Number, Boolean, Null,
  Undefined, Symbol, and BigInt. Note that Symbols uniquely identify variables, even if two variables have the 
  same data and data type. Primitive variables datatype is same but null datatype is object 

2) Non-primitive: These are call-by-reference. The types of non-primitive data types are Array, Object, and Function.
   The data type for these is 'object,' but for functions, they return a data type of 'function,' though they also have
   an object data type.
